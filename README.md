# Classification_of_patients
At the moment, erysipelas are the 4th most common in the world among infectious diseases and, in most cases, can be cured. The main symptoms of this disease are fever, pressure, palpitations, headaches, loss of sleep and appetite. Therefore, it is proposed to develop a machine learning model that, based on these symptoms, is able to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment and, if necessary, adjust or change it.
Since the goal of the work is very complex, at this stage only the classification of patients according to how quickly and easily treatment was received will be solved.
